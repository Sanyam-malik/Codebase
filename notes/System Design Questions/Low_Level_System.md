# Low-Level System Design Questions

This document contains a collection of low-level system design questions, organized from easy to hard levels. These questions are designed to help individuals deepen their understanding of software architecture and design principles.

## Easy Level Questions

1. **URL Parser**:
    - Design a URL parser that extracts the components of a URL (protocol, domain, port, path, query parameters, fragment).

2. **Stack Implementation**:
    - Design a stack data structure with operations like push, pop, and peek.

3. **Queue Implementation**:
    - Design a queue data structure with operations like enqueue and dequeue.

4. **Cache Implementation**:
    - Design a simple in-memory cache with operations like get and put.

## Medium Level Questions

5. **Database Connection Pool**:
    - Design a database connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.

6. **Thread Pool**:
    - Design a thread pool to manage and reuse threads for executing tasks.

7. **Web Server**:
    - Design a basic web server capable of handling HTTP requests.

8. **Key-Value Store**:
    - Design a key-value store that supports basic operations like get, put, and delete.

9. **LRU Cache**:
    - Design an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with operations like get and put.

## Hard Level Questions

10. **Distributed Locking System**:
    - Design a distributed locking system to coordinate access to shared resources across multiple nodes.

11. **Message Queue**:
    - Design a message queue system for asynchronous communication between components of a distributed system.

12. **Load Balancer**:
    - Design a load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve scalability and reliability.

13. **Distributed Cache**:
    - Design a distributed cache system to store frequently accessed data across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

14. **Distributed Logging System**:
    - Design a distributed logging system to collect and aggregate log data from multiple sources efficiently.
