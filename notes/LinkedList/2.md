# Fast and Slow Pointers Technique in a LinkedList

## Introduction

The fast and slow pointers technique is a widely used strategy for solving various problems efficiently in linked lists. This technique involves using two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds to achieve a certain goal.

## Use Cases

### 1. Detecting Cycle in a Linked List

One of the common applications of the fast and slow pointers technique is to detect a cycle in a linked list. By moving one pointer (slow) one step at a time and another pointer (fast) two steps at a time, if there is a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.

### 2. Finding the Middle of the Linked List

The fast and slow pointers technique can be used to efficiently find the middle element of a linked list. By moving one pointer (slow) one step at a time and another pointer (fast) two steps at a time, when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle element.

### 3. Finding the Nth Node from the End of the Linked List

Another application of the fast and slow pointers technique is to find the Nth node from the end of a linked list efficiently. By initializing both pointers at the head of the list and moving the fast pointer N steps ahead, then moving both pointers together until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the Nth node from the end.

## Code

The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to implement the fast and slow pointers technique to solve various problems efficiently in a linked list.

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class LinkedList {
    private Node head;

    public LinkedList() {
        head = null;
    }

    // Method to insert a new node at the end of the list
    public void insert(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
            return;
        }
        Node current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
    }

    // Method to print the linked list
    public void printList() {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.data + " ");
            current = current.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    // Method to detect cycle in the linked list using fast and slow pointers
    public boolean hasCycle() {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head.next;
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
                return false;
            }
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Method to find the middle element of the linked list using fast and slow pointers
    public int findMiddle() {
        if (head == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("List is empty");
        }
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return slow.data;
    }

    // Method to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list using fast and slow pointers
    public int findNthFromEnd(int n) {
        if (head == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("List is empty");
        }
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (fast == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value of 'n' exceeds the length of the list");
            }
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        while (fast != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        return slow.data;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
        list.insert(1);
        list.insert(2);
        list.insert(3);
        list.insert(4);
        list.insert(5);

        // Print the list
        System.out.print("Linked List: ");
        list.printList(); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5

        // Check for cycle
        System.out.println("Has Cycle: " + list.hasCycle()); // Output: Has Cycle: false

        // Find the middle element
        System.out.println("Middle Element: " + list.findMiddle()); // Output: Middle Element: 3

        // Find the 2nd node from the end
        System.out.println("2nd Node from End: " + list.findNthFromEnd(2)); // Output: 2nd Node from End: 4
    }
}
